# Planner Board

This application is designed to help you organize and manage your tasks efficiently. Below, you'll find all the necessary information to get started with the application.

# Idea for the project

The Personal Board is designed with the idea of creating a single platform where users can manage all of their work, personal tasks, and goals on a single board. The board is divided into three sections, which are as follows: pending, working, and completed. Based on the requirement, the user can create tasks or "cards," which can be placed into one of these categories. And according to the needs of users, they can move from one category to another. Once the task is done, the user can also delete the card or task.

## Features

-   **Task Management**: Create, Edit and Delete Task.
-   **Drag and Drop Cards**: Drag and drop feature is added for smooth UI experience.

## Usage

-   **Create a Card/Task**: To add a new card/task, simply click on the top "Add Card" button, and a modal will pop up where you can fill in the information.
-   **Edit a Card/Task**: Clicking on the card/task itself will open a modal with prefilled data based on the card, and the user can either choose to edit the input fields or simply choose the column where he wants to move the card.
-   **Delete a Card/Task**: Similar process: just like editing, clicking on the card/task will open a modal where the user can find the delete button and delete the card/task.
-   **Drag and Drop Card/Task**: The user can also move the card from one column to another based on his requirements, which is achieved using drag-and-drop functionality.
